The dlls provided for demostration are simple proxy DLLs,
created with a Wrapper Generator script by m4v3n.

When loaded, a proxy DLL will load the original DLL from C:\Windows\System32
using LoadLibraryA API call and export the original functions.
This allows the calling program to continue functioning normally.

Upon loading, the proxy DLL will spawn command line window.

These DLLs are here for a PoC and are compiled for Windows 10 x86 and x64.
